# Multivariate-Analysis-of-Olive-oil

### Introduction 

This document presents a detailed multivariate analysis of olive oil samples using various statistical techniques. The analysis includes data exploration, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering to understand the underlying patterns and relationships among different olive oil samples. 

### Dataset

The dataset *oliveoil* contains 572 rows, each corresponding to a different specimen of olive oil, and 10 columns. 

The first and the second column correspond to the macro-area (`Centre-North`, `South`, `Sardinia`) and the region of origin of the olive oils, respectively. 
Columns 3-10 represent the following 8 chemical measurements on the acid components for the oil specimens: `palmitic`, `palmitoleic`, `stearic`, `oleic`, `linoleic`, `linolenic`, `arachidic`, `eicosenoic`.
